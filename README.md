# Advent Of Code (Python)

During the month of December 2015 the first [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) was hosted.

Having wanted to learn python for several years I used this as a jumping off point for practicing my python. I plan on completing the Advent Of Code challenge and participating in more in the future.

I now use python on several projects at work as a quick and easy development/automation tool.
