# Advent Of Code 2015 (Python)

During the month of December 2015 the first [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) was hosted.

Having wanted to learn python for several years I used this as a jumping off point for practicing my python. I plan on completing the Advent Of Code challenge and participating in more in the future.

I now use python on several projects at work as a quick and easy development/automation tool.

# Caesar Cipher

My buddies at work and I often do puzzles on Friday. 

My friend Kevin created this [Caesar substitution puzzle](http://www.armoredpenguin.com/cipher/Data/2016.09/2306/23061735.911.html).

As an engineer I generally avoid "word" puzzles and therefore decided to practice my python to brute force the problem.

"Caesar substitution puzzle. Each letter of the alphabet is shifted by an unknown amount. Find the value of that shift and you decode the work related phrases." --Kevin
